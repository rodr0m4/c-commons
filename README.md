My take on sisoputnfrba's 'commons' library. It uses snow for testing, so its C99 :) (I don't really use post ANSI-C features, so it's valid for the class).

## TODO:

* higher-order functions (macros?) on arrays
* TOML/YAML? (whichever is easier :P) parser
* Socket abstractions
* Maps/Dictionaries
